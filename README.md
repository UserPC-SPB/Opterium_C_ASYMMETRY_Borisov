# OPTERIUM: Canonical Physics & Ontology Engine

## Abstract
Opterium is a fundamental reconstruction of physical reality based on the **Axiom of Primary Asymmetry (A(E) > 0)**. It replaces the abstract mathematical "point" with the topological "relation," defining time not as a parameter but as the gradient of entropic tension (Reeb Flow) within the E8 lattice.

## Repository Structure

### 1. The Ontology (Human Readable)
Located in [`THEORY_OF_ASYMMETRY.md`](./THEORY_OF_ASYMMETRY.md).
This document contains the complete philosophical and mathematical proof of the Primary Asymmetry Constant, including:
- The ontological definitions of S (Absolute Symmetry) and E (Entity).
- The proof of the Achronal Theorem.
- The geometric derivation of Time and Sequence.
*Format: Academic/Philosophical Text.*

### 2. The Kernel Specifications (Machine Readable)
Located in [`opterium_kernel_specs.json`](./opterium_kernel_specs.json).
This contains the strict, machine-ingestible definitions for the AI Physics Engine (HyperCore), including:
- The 64 Canonical Blocks.
- The revised "Hard-Core" mathematical axioms.
- The ZDT Tunneling and Reeb Flow protocols.
*Format: Strict JSON.*

## Status
- **Ontology:** CANONICAL / CLOSED (64 Blocks)
- **Kernel:** V4.0 STABLE (Tested via HyperCore Lab)
- **Paradigm:** Generative Geometry (No Float, No Imaginary Numbers)
