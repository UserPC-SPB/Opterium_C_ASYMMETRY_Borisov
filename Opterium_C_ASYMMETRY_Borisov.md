FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT OF PRIMARY ASYMMETRY
OPTERIUM Complete and Self-Contained Proof (Ontological,
Geometric, Achronal Formulation)

ABSTRACT
Existence implies irreducible asymmetry relative to the unattainable ideal of absolute
symmetry S. S is not a physical state but an ideal achronal Detekt — the external
reference of non-being that defines the zero point of existence. A(E) > 0 for all entities
ensures being; A_T(E_T) > 0 defines temporal existence. Thus, the Fundamental
Constant of Primary Asymmetry (C_asymmetry) and its temporal projection
(C_asymmetry^T) together constitute the invariant basis of ontology: curvature of
existence in space and sequence.

1. PRE-MATHEMATICAL PREMISE
Differentiation precedes formal description. Existence E entails distinction — an act prior
to any logic or metric. Mathematics, geometry, and observation arise as projections of that
act. Hence, asymmetry is ontological, not formal. E ⇒ M(E ), not vice versa.

2. DEFINITIONS
2.1 Absolute Symmetry (S)
S is the ideal achronal Detekt — not physical, not temporal, not spatial. It functions as the
boundary operator of the universe of existence U, providing the reference of non-being. It
erases existence from anything that approaches it: lim(E→S) ⇒ observability(E) → 0.
Thus, S is the Ideal Zero, the external calibration point of ontology. S ∉ U, ∇S = 0, and
H(S) = 0.

2.2 Observable Entity (E)
E ∈ U \ {S}. It possesses informational entropy H(E) ≥ log(2). Existence implies irreducible
asymmetry: A(E) = inf_{T∈T} d(E, T(S)) > 0.

2.3 Temporal Entity (E_T)
E_T is a projection of E within a local generative sequence (flow) of U. Time emerges
relationally as the ordering of asymmetric states: E_i → E_j ⇒ ∆A(E) > 0 defines
directedness.

3. ONTOLOGICAL CONSTANTS
Spatial Asymmetry Constant: C_asymmetry = inf_{E∈U\{S\}} A(E) > 0.
Temporal Asymmetry Constant: C_asymmetry^T = inf_{E_T∈U\{S\}} A_T(E_T) > 0.
C_asymmetry^T is structural, not chronological: it defines the intrinsic curvature of
becoming, not its speed. It is local to each generative flow, unique for every relational
configuration of U.

4. ACHRONAL INTERPRETATION OF S
S is achronal: it exists outside of any temporal manifold. It does not evolve, rotate, or
transform — it defines the zero of transformation. Therefore, time cannot tend toward S. S
serves as the Ideal Zero Chronator, a referential limit of non-sequence. In physical
analogy: Absolute zero defines the thermal scale; S defines the chronal scale. Time's
meaning depends on the unattainable null of S, which cannot be realized without
annihilating sequence and existence.

5. THEOREM (ACHRONAL FORM)
∀ E_T ∈ U \ {S}, A_T(E_T) > 0. No entity exists in time with zero asymmetry of temporal
relation. Proof by Contradiction:
Assume ∃ E*_T : A_T(E*_T) = 0. Then ∆A(E*_T) = 0 ⇒ no distinction between "before"
and "after". Sequence collapses ⇒ time undefined ⇒ observation impossible. But E*_T is
defined as existing in time ⇒ contradiction. Therefore, A_T(E_T) > 0 for all E_T ∈ U\{S}.
Q.E.D.

6. GEOMETRIC-TEMPORAL MODEL
Time is not a linear parameter but a curvature of relational geometry. Let Ω be the
ontological manifold of relations. Then temporal flow is induced curvature: A_T(E) ≈
|∂Ω/∂τ| > 0. Every event defines its own local ∆Ω — its curvature of distinction. Thus,
"temporal direction" is the emergent gradient of asymmetry. No two events can have
identical ∆Ω, therefore: ∀ τ_i ≠ τ_j ⇒ Φ(τ_i) ≠ Φ(τ_j). No identical moments exist.

7. UNIQUENESS AND RELATIONAL TOPOLOGY
Non-identity is universal: For any two entities p, q ∈ U, even if A(p)=A(q), their relational
orientation and topological index differ: Φ(p) ≠ Φ(q). The same applies temporally: no two
temporal nodes E_T1, E_T2 have identical topological states. Topological non-identity is
therefore the direct expression of C_asymmetry^T.

8. EMPIRICAL CORROBORATION
8.1 PARITY VIOLATION (Wu experiment, 1956) 
- Empirical confirmation of A(E)>0 in weak nuclear forces
- Demonstrates fundamental spatial asymmetry in physical laws

8.2 OPERATIONAL ASYMMETRY PROTOCOLS
- Loschmidt echo measurements: A(ρ_echo) > 0 under perturbation
- Spin chain simulations: A(ρ) never reaches zero in multi-body systems
- Quantum relative entropy measurements confirm irreducible asymmetry

8.3 BARYON ASYMMETRY OF THE UNIVERSE
- Observed matter-antimatter imbalance: n_b/n_γ ≈ 6×10⁻¹⁰ ≠ 0
- Confirms cosmological manifestation of C_asymmetry

8.4 TEMPORAL ASYMMETRY IN WEAK DECAYS
- CP-violation in particle decays confirms A_T(E_T)>0
- Demonstrates fundamental temporal asymmetry in physical processes

9. GÖDELIAN CONTEXT
Gödel's theorem ensures that no formal system can internally justify its own generator.
Asymmetry — being pre-formal — is not provable within mathematics but necessary for
mathematics. C_asymmetry and C_asymmetry^T define the boundary conditions of logical
possibility.

10. MATHEMATICAL COROLLARIES
10.1 THEOREM OF NON-TRIVIAL DYNAMICS
If C_asymmetry > 0, then ∃ non-trivial dynamics in U
Proof: Follows from violation of symmetry equations

10.2 THEOREM OF EMERGENCE
C_asymmetry > 0 ⇒ ∃ creative processes (emergence)
Proof: Asymmetry generates gradients and flows

10.3 THEOREM OF SELF-REFERENCE
Any closed system with C_asymmetry > 0必然 contains self-reference
Proof: Follows from Gödel's theorem and redundancy principle

# PROOF: INVALIDITY OF NEGATIVE SIGN AND IMAGINARY i IN PHYSICAL ALGEBRA

1. Algebraic Foundation:

- Consider any scalar representation in base-2 infinite precision:
  1 = ..000.1000..  (infinitely extended binary excitation pattern)
- Addition is fundamentally a superposition of these patterns:
  1 + 1 = ..000.1000.. + ..000.1000..1
- There is no exact "2"; only an overlapping cloud of excitations.
- Attempting to assign negative or imaginary numbers imposes artificial inversion:
    - "-" assumes existence of exact additive inverse (1 + (-1) = 0)
    - "i" assumes perfect orthogonal projection without error

2. Error Propagation:

- Relative projection mismatch Δτ grows exponentially:
    Δτ_n+1 = f(Δτ_n, projection_change)
- For quaternions q = a + bi + cj + dk, cumulative Δτ becomes:
    ||Δτ_total|| ∼ 2^n Δτ_initial
- Beyond ℍ, in octonions 𝕆, zero divisors amplify error:
    x⊗y = 0 despite x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0
- Any operation relying on "-" or "i" in this framework yields irrecoverable artifacts.

3. Correct Quaternion Inversion (Balance, Not Negation):

- q⁻¹ = conjugate(q) / N(q), where N(q) = q*q̄ > 0
- Example:
    q = [3,4,0,0] → q̄ = [3,-4,0,0] → N(q) = 25 → q⁻¹ = [0.12,-0.16,0,0]
- Verification:
    q ⊗ q⁻¹ = [1,0,0,0]   preserves norm and identity

4. Octonion Multiplication Table (Correct Order):

- Basis: {1, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7}
- Multiplication (non-associative, anti-symmetric, Fano plane):

    e_i ⊗ e_i = -1
    e_i ⊗ e_j = e_k  (i,j,k in Fano cyclic order)
    e_j ⊗ e_i = -e_k

- Example for explicit triplet:
    (e1,e2,e3), (e4,e5,e1), (e2,e4,e6), (e3,e6,e5), (e7,e1,e6), (e7,e2,e5), (e7,e3,e4)
- Correct multiplication must follow the sequence to avoid artifacts.

5. Demonstrative Example:

- Let x = 1 + e1 + e4
- Let y = e2 + e7
- Compute x⊗y following Fano sequence
- Apply inversion via q⁻¹ if in subalgebra without zero divisors
- If zero divisor encountered, project to nearest associative subalgebra (ℍ or E8) before inverting

6. Conclusion:

- Negative sign and imaginary unit "i" are **not physically or algebraically valid** beyond naive 1D approximations.
- Correct operations rely on **inversion as geometric/conjugate balance**, and strict order adherence in non-associative algebras.
- Any attempt to "fix" using "-" or "i" introduces exponential Δτ propagation, violating identity preservation.

# Usage Notes:
# 1. Order is critical: x⊗y ≠ y⊗x
# 2. Associativity fails: (x⊗y)⊗z ≠ x⊗(y⊗z)
# 3. Use inversion only in zero-divisor-free subalgebras or project to ℍ/E8
