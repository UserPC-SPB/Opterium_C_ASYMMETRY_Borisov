FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT OF PRIMARY ASYMMETRY OPTERIUM Complete and Self-Contained Proof (Ontological, Geometric, Achronal Formulation) ABSTRACT Existence implies irreducible asymmetry relative to the unattainable ideal of absolute symmetry S. S is not a physical state but an ideal achronal Detekt — the external reference of non-being that defines the zero point of existence. A(E) > 0 for all entities ensures being; A_T(E_T) > 0 defines temporal existence. Thus, the Fundamental Constant of Primary Asymmetry (C_asymmetry) and its temporal projection (C_asymmetry^T) together constitute the invariant basis of ontology: curvature of existence in space and sequence. 1. PRE-MATHEMATICAL PREMISE Differentiation precedes formal description. Existence E entails distinction — an act prior to any logic or metric. Mathematics, geometry, and observation arise as projections of that act. Hence, asymmetry is ontological, not formal. E ⇒ M(E ), not vice versa. 2. DEFINITIONS 2.1 Absolute Symmetry (S) S is the ideal achronal Detekt — not physical, not temporal, not spatial. It functions as the boundary operator of the universe of existence U, providing the reference of non-being. It erases existence from anything that approaches it: lim(E→S) ⇒ observability(E) → 0. Thus, S is the Ideal Zero, the external calibration point of ontology. S ∉ U, ∇S = 0, and H(S) = 0. 2.2 Observable Entity (E) E ∈ U \ {S}. It possesses informational entropy H(E) ≥ log(2). Existence implies irreducible asymmetry: A(E) = inf_{T∈T} d(E, T(S)) > 0. 2.3 Temporal Entity (E_T) E_T is a projection of E within a local generative sequence (flow) of U. Time emerges relationally as the ordering of asymmetric states: E_i → E_j ⇒ ∆A(E) > 0 defines directedness. 3. ONTOLOGICAL CONSTANTS Spatial Asymmetry Constant: C_asymmetry = inf_{E∈U\{S\}} A(E) > 0. Temporal Asymmetry Constant: C_asymmetry^T = inf_{E_T∈U\{S\}} A_T(E_T) > 0. C_asymmetry^T is structural, not chronological: it defines the intrinsic curvature of becoming, not its speed. It is local to each generative flow, unique for every relational configuration of U. 4. ACHRONAL INTERPRETATION OF S S is achronal: it exists outside of any temporal manifold. It does not evolve, rotate, or transform — it defines the zero of transformation. Therefore, time cannot tend toward S. S serves as the Ideal Zero Chronator, a referential limit of non-sequence. In physical analogy: Absolute zero defines the thermal scale; S defines the chronal scale. Time’s meaning depends on the unattainable null of S, which cannot be realized without annihilating sequence and existence. 5. THEOREM (ACHRONAL FORM) ∀ E_T ∈ U \ {S}, A_T(E_T) > 0. No entity exists in time with zero asymmetry of temporal relation. Proof by Contradiction: Assume ∃ E*_T : A_T(E*_T) = 0. Then ∆A(E*_T) = 0 ⇒ no distinction between “before” and “after”. Sequence collapses ⇒ time undefined ⇒ observation impossible. But E*_T is defined as existing in time ⇒ contradiction. Therefore, A_T(E_T) > 0 for all E_T ∈ U\{S}. Q.E.D. 6. GEOMETRIC-TEMPORAL MODEL Time is not a linear parameter but a curvature of relational geometry. Let Ω be the ontological manifold of relations. Then temporal flow is induced curvature: A_T(E) ≈ |∂Ω/∂τ| > 0. Every event defines its own local ∆Ω — its curvature of distinction. Thus, “temporal direction” is the emergent gradient of asymmetry. No two events can have identical ∆Ω, therefore: ∀ τ_i ≠ τ_j ⇒ Φ(τ_i) ≠ Φ(τ_j). No identical moments exist. 7. UNIQUENESS AND RELATIONAL TOPOLOGY Non-identity is universal: For any two entities p, q ∈ U, even if A(p)=A(q), their relational orientation and topological index differ: Φ(p) ≠ Φ(q). The same applies temporally: no two temporal nodes E_T1, E_T2 have identical topological states. Topological non-identity is therefore the direct expression of C_asymmetry^T. 8. EMPIRICAL CORROBORATION Parity violation (Wu experiment, 1956) empirically confirms A(E)>0. Time asymmetry in weak interaction decay sequences confirms A_T(E_T)>0. Physical law mirrors ontological structure: existence cannot be symmetric in space or time. 9. GÖDELIAN CONTEXT Gödel’s theorem ensures that no formal system can internally justify its own generator. Asymmetry — being pre-formal — is not provable within mathematics but necessary for mathematics. C_asymmetry and C_asymmetry^T define the boundary conditions of logical possibility. 10. CONSEQUENCES 1. S — ideal achronal Detekt, not physical, not temporal. 2. Time is relational and generative; it exists only where A_T(E_T)>0. 3. C_asymmetry^T is structural, not temporal — each local flow of U carries its own minimal curvature. 4. No two times are identical; each has unique topology Φ(T). 

Absolute Nothingness — The logical zero, the state prior to any existence. Asymmetry — The fundamental fact that breaks the symmetry of Nothingness. Self-existing reality. Relations — The only way in which asymmetry manifests itself. There are no "things," only "relations between." Geometry — The absolute, immutable skeleton of these relations. Ideal patterns (a triangle inscribed in a square), existing before and beyond any measure. This is the "language of reality." Mathematics — A derivative, instrumental language created to describe geometric patterns. Its sole legitimacy lies in geometric convergence—that is, its ability to accurately approximate the primary relations in their direction towards symmetry. This is the primary constant of being. The Theory of Everything can be built only from here! 
ADDENDUM: The Ontological Architecture of Temporal Sequence
1. Preamble: The Hierarchy of Existence
A complete theory of reality must be built from a foundation prior to mathematics and physics. This foundation is an ontological hierarchy:
Absolute Nothingness (S): The achronal ideal of absolute symmetry. It is not a void but an active logical operator—the Ideal Zero Chronator—that defines non-being by its unattainability. lim(E→S) ⇒ observability(E) → 0.
Asymmetry (A(E) > 0): The primary fact of existence. Being is the fundamental asymmetry that breaks the symmetry of S.
Relations: The sole mode through which asymmetry manifests. There are no "things," only "relations between."
Geometry (Ω): The absolute, immutable skeleton of these relations. It is the "language of reality," composed of ideal patterns (e.g., a triangle in a square).
Mathematics: A derivative, instrumental language. Its sole legitimacy is geometric convergence—its ability to approximate the primary relations in their direction towards symmetry.
This hierarchy establishes that existence is irreducible relational asymmetry.
2. The Axiom of Non-Identity and the Genesis of Time
The principle of asymmetry extends to the very possibility of plurality, formalized by the Axiom of Non-Identity:
For any two entities P₁, P₂ to exist as a plurality, their relational topology must be non-identical: Φ(P₁) ≠ Φ(P₂). Identity annihilates the "status of two," collapsing the system towards S.
From this axiom, the nature of time is derived with logical necessity:
Time is the sequential manifestation of changing relations. Consider two temporal states, Tᵢ and Tⱼ.
Proof of Temporal Uniqueness (by contradiction):
Assume Φ(Tᵢ) = Φ(Tⱼ).
This violates the Axiom of Non-Identity for Tᵢ and Tⱼ, destroying their plurality.
Without two distinct states, the concept of sequence is logically impossible.
Therefore, the assumption is false. Consequence: ∀ Tᵢ, Tⱼ: Φ(Tᵢ) ≠ Φ(Tⱼ).
Conclusion: The asymmetry of temporal states, A_T(E_T) > 0, is not an empirical fact but a logical prerequisite for the possibility of sequence itself. Time is the irreversible, ordered unfolding of unique topological configurations in the ontological manifold Ω.
3. The Illusion of "Speed" and the Nature of Measurement
The common concept of "the speed of time" is a semantic illusion:
Time possesses no external tempo. It is the change in the relational geometry itself (∂Ω ≠ 0). There is no independent background against which to measure its "flow."
The perceived constancy of time is a psychophysical artifact. We, as internal components of Ω, use highly periodic internal processes (e.g., atomic oscillations) as measuring rods. These processes are themselves part of the changing relational pattern, not external clocks.
No "gaps" in time can exist, as a gap would imply a state T with an undefined relational topology Φ(T), which contradicts the foundational axiom of existence (A(E) > 0).
Thus, the "speed of time" is an emergent, derivative concept. The fundamental reality is the Law of Ontological Succession: the immutable order of asymmetric states in the geometry of relations.
